# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

The team will first analyse the different methods that do not meet the stated requirements and then do the respective du-pairs for each of these methods. We will then look at previous tests we’ve written for that method and improve them if they are improperly written or do not adequately cover a du-pair. The team will then look at all the du-pairs we have not written any tests for and write methods for those pairs and re-do coverage tests to ensure they are actually improving the test suite. After executing the coverages, the team will go into the classes and look at the specific methods and see which lines were covered (indicated by green highlight for covered, and red or yellow for missed). Given this information, each member will work on a test which did not cover each line and attempt to get full line coverage (all green highlighted). Once members are done improving their assigned tests, they will check other’s tests to ensure there is proper coverage and the tests are written logically. Generally, the team plans to tackle statement coverage first and then look at condition and then branch and method coverage. This is done to make sure no lines of the method are missed. 

Below are the old coverages from Assignment 2.

The original tests for createNumberArray that we wrote for assignment 2 had 100% coverage for all categories and thus we were not able to improve coverage for this method.

We were unable to improve the coverage of the contains test because the two missed branch instructions on line 165 are covered by the code on lines 159 and 162, thus making it logically impossible to cover those instructions. If lines 159-164 are removed the coverage increases to 100% in all categories and all branches on line 165 are covered.

getLength():

![alt text](https://github.com/seng438-winter-2023/seng438-a3-christinaWyllie/blob/main/Images/getLength2.png)

We were unable to improve the coverage for getLength, getUpperBound and getLowerBound because the lines were logically impossible to cover. Each method checks to make sure that lower < upper even though this is already checked when a range object is instantiated. Thus we can never have a Range object where upper < lower so we cannot increase the coverage. A Range object can never be created where upper < lower thus those lines can never be covered by a test case. 

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

The team chose eclEmma as their coverage tool. 

Pros:
- Easy to download and access because it is integrated with Eclipse
- Shows line, branch, and method coverage which are the aspects we have to improve on
- User friendly interface for viewing the coverages quickly (the red green bar coverage)


Cons:
- Hard to understand what coverage percentages initially meant and how to access them
- Does not have condition coverage (This would be useful in improving if statement testing)
- Issues with using JMock and allowing certain coverages that can’t be achieved. 
- Does not specify which branches were missed only gives the ratio of branches covered

Due to EclEmma not having condition coverage, the team has replaced that with method coverage. 



# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

The advantages to requirements based testing that we found was that having clear well defined requirements made it much easier to determine what methods need to be tested and to what extent they need to be tested. As well, having clear requirements made it easier to make a test plan and figure out what to test each method for. 

The disadvantage to this was that since we didn’t know what the source code actually looked like it made writing the tests more difficult. For example, one of the tests we wrote for assignment 2 was to test if the correct exception was thrown. When running the test we found that it didn’t throw the correct exception and were unsure if this was because of an error in the way we wrote the test or if it was a bug in the source code.

There are advantages to coverage based testing that we found while working on this lab. It helped us identify instructions in the source code that would never run because they are logically impossible or redundant. For example one group member found that the only way to execute a loop in one of her methods was to have a negative number of rows which is logically impossible. Another group member had code with 4 branches where two of the branches were covered before the code even reached that line. In industry these line could be removed. The advantage of this is that it simplifies the source code and reduces redundancies. 

The disadvantage is the focus shifts to making sure all lines, branches, methods etc. are tested. For example, during this lab, to increase coverage we wrote tests that passed in values that were logically impossible but accomplished our goal of increasing the test coverage, such as passing in a row count of less than 0. In industry this could be a disadvantage because instead of testing to make sure that all functionality set out by the customer is covered, the tests cover only the code that is written.

8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed
Any test that needed improved coverage was worked on by the same person who wrote that test in assignment 2. Some tests already had great coverage or 100% coverage so the members who did not need to re-write their tests took some of the ones that did need improvement and also contributed to writing to the lab document more. Work was divided evenly among each group member to ensure that everyone gains experience with using coverages and writing additional tests.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

In this lab, we encountered a few difficulties in increasing the test coverage. The provided JFreeChart code had many unreachable if statements and loops that could not be tested. We also found JMock very difficult to use with our coverage tool, EclEmma. Despite these challenges, there were still many methods that we were able to increase the coverage for. We found that having access to the source code allowed us to clearly identify different branches in the code, and analyse which branches weren’t being tested and why. Because of this, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of how the code worked and write new tests accordingly. 


# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Please specify that external libraries should be added when making a new project rather than making it a note. The team had struggles setting up a proper project due to missing libraries that couldn’t be added. There are also missing libraries from the a3_artifacts folder and we had to add them from the ones given in assignment 2. It is recommended that the issue either be fixed or it is stated in the lab document directly to add all the libraries given in assignment 2 before starting assignment 3. There are also broken image links that are meant to display how the EclEmma tool works. The team had to spend a lot of extra time figuring out how to extract coverages.
