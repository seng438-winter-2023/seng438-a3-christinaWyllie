# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

The team will first analyse the different methods that do not meet the stated requirements and then do the respective du-pairs for each of these methods. We will then look at previous tests we’ve written for that method and improve them if they are improperly written or do not adequately cover a du-pair. The team will then look at all the du-pairs we have not written any tests for and write methods for those pairs and re-do coverage tests to ensure they are actually improving the test suite. After executing the coverages, the team will go into the classes and look at the specific methods and see which lines were covered (indicated by green highlight for covered, and red or yellow for missed). Given this information, each member will work on a test which did not cover each line and attempt to get full line coverage (all green highlighted). Once members are done improving their assigned tests, they will check other’s tests to ensure there is proper coverage and the tests are written logically. Generally, the team plans to tackle statement coverage first and then look at condition and then branch and method coverage. This is done to make sure no lines of the method are missed. 

Below are the old coverages from Assignment 2.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

The team chose eclEmma as their coverage tool. 
Pros:
- Easy to download and access because it is integrated with Eclipse
- Shows line, branch, and method coverage which are the aspects we have to improve on
- User friendly interface for viewing the coverages quickly (the red green bar coverage)
Cons:
- Hard to understand what coverage percentages initially meant and how to access them
- Does not have condition coverage (This would be useful in improving if statement testing)
- Issues with using JMock and allowing certain coverages that can’t be achieved. 
- Does not specify which branches were missed only gives the ratio of branches covered

Due to EclEmma not having condition coverage, the team has replaced that with method coverage.
